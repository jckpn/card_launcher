A very basic launcher developed using Flutter, made with help from @hathibelagal-dev's launcher-assist plugin: https://github.com/hathibelagal-dev/launcher-assist-for-flutter

You can see screenshots and other info on the Play Store listing: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jckpn.cardlauncher

Feel free to snoop around the code and copy parts, but please don't publish any obvious clones of this :)
